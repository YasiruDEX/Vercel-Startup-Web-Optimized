# Uber, Lucid, and Nuro Unveil Global Robotaxi Partnership

San Francisco, Mountain View, and Newark, Calif,   Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID), Nuro, Inc., and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER) today announced a multi-year partnership to launch a next-generation autonomous robotaxi service exclusively on the Uber platform. The program aims to deploy more than 20,000 Lucid vehicles powered by Nuro’s Level 4 autonomous driving system over the next six years.

The robotaxi initiative combines Lucid’s advanced EV technology, Nuro’s AI-first autonomous platform, and Uber’s vast global network, with the first pilot expected to launch in a major U.S. city in 2026. The fully electric, fully autonomous vehicles will be manufactured by Lucid with Nuro’s Driver™ system factory-integrated and commissioned by Uber and its fleet partners.

This strategic collaboration positions Uber to scale autonomous mobility through its presence in over 70 countries and its average of 34 million daily trips. With a targeted deployment of over 20,000 vehicles globally, the partnership aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance fleet efficiency, and broaden access to autonomous rideshare options in both urban and suburban areas.

Lucid’s Gravity SUV platform, featuring a 450-mile EPA-estimated range and redundant zonal vehicle architecture, will serve as the foundation for the robotaxi. Nuro’s Driver™, a Level 4 autonomous system, integrates AI-powered software with automotive-grade hardware built for reliability and scale. Initial test units are already running autonomously at Nuro’s Las Vegas proving grounds.

Uber will support the collaboration with investments totaling several hundred million dollars in both Lucid and Nuro. This funding will accelerate the development, deployment, and scaling of the robotaxi program.

“Autonomous vehicles have the power to reimagine transportation for cities around the world,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber. “This partnership is designed from the ground up for Uber’s platform, safe, scalable, and built for people.”

Marc Winterhoff, Interim CEO at Lucid, added, “This validates Lucid’s next-generation platform and furthers our mission to expand beyond traditional EVs into the future of mobility services.”

Jiajun Zhu, Co-Founder and CEO at Nuro, emphasized, “We’re proud to combine Nuro’s proven autonomy system with Lucid’s platform and Uber’s scale to bring high-quality, safe, and reliable robotaxi service to millions globally.”

Nuro will lead the development of a comprehensive safety framework, leveraging simulation, closed-course testing, and supervised on-road operations to meet or exceed regulatory and public safety standards.

This partnership reflects a shared vision for a more sustainable, efficient, and connected future of mobility, where accessing a self-driving ride is as easy as tapping a button.
