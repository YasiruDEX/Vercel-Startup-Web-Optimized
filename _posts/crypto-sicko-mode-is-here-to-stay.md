# MicroStrategy Paid Well Over $100,000 Per Coin in Its Latest Bitcoin Purchases

MicroStrategy, the **business intelligence** company that has become a key player in the world of cryptocurrency, continues to make bold moves in its **Bitcoin investment strategy**. In its most recent **Bitcoin purchase**, the company paid well over **$100,000 per coin**, a significant premium compared to earlier acquisitions. This latest purchase has raised eyebrows in both the **traditional finance world** and the **crypto community**. With Bitcoin’s price fluctuating and the market facing new challenges, the question arises: why is MicroStrategy doubling down on Bitcoin at such high prices?

In this blog post, we’ll dive into **MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition**, the rationale behind paying more than $100,000 per coin, and what it means for the future of **Bitcoin** and **institutional investment** in the digital asset space.

### MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Journey

MicroStrategy’s journey into the world of Bitcoin began in **August 2020**, when the company made a historic decision to convert part of its **cash reserves** into Bitcoin. At the time, the company’s CEO, **Michael Saylor**, expressed his belief that Bitcoin offered a far superior store of value compared to traditional assets like gold or fiat currencies. He argued that Bitcoin’s **deflationary nature**, with its **capped supply** of 21 million coins, made it an ideal hedge against **inflation** and **currency devaluation**.

Over the years, MicroStrategy has aggressively built its Bitcoin portfolio. As of **2024**, the company holds over **124,000 Bitcoin**, with an average purchase price around **$30,000 per coin**. This makes it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, a title it’s held since 2021. With each purchase, MicroStrategy has solidified its position as one of the most visible and vocal advocates for **Bitcoin** in the corporate world.

However, its most recent purchases, made in **2024**, have attracted attention due to the **premium price** the company paid—well over $100,000 per Bitcoin. Let’s explore why MicroStrategy has chosen to continue buying Bitcoin at such elevated prices.

### Paying Over $100,000 Per Bitcoin: Why?

When MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases were disclosed, many were surprised to see the company paying more than **$100,000 per Bitcoin**. This price point is significantly higher than the average price MicroStrategy has paid for its previous Bitcoin holdings. So, why would a company that has already accumulated over 120,000 Bitcoin choose to make purchases at such a high cost?

Here are a few potential reasons for this strategic decision:

#### 1. **Long-Term Faith in Bitcoin’s Future**

One of the most important factors behind MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy is its **long-term outlook** on the asset. **Michael Saylor** and his team believe that Bitcoin’s price will increase over time, making today’s purchase prices seem inconsequential in the future. The company views Bitcoin not just as an investment but as a **store of value** that will appreciate as more institutions and governments adopt it.

In fact, Saylor has publicly stated that he believes Bitcoin will one day reach **$1 million per coin**, a bold prediction that underscores the company’s **long-term faith** in the asset. By continuing to buy Bitcoin at these higher prices, MicroStrategy is essentially betting that **Bitcoin’s value will increase exponentially** over the coming years, making its current purchases look like bargains in hindsight.

#### 2. **Strategic Timing and Market Conditions**

Bitcoin’s price has been volatile, as is typical with any cryptocurrency. While the coin has fluctuated dramatically in the past, it has shown significant growth over the long term. MicroStrategy’s decision to continue buying at over **$100,000 per coin** may be seen as an effort to **capture Bitcoin’s future growth**, even during periods of market uncertainty or price dips.

At times when Bitcoin’s price is **trading higher**, investors and institutions may be less inclined to buy, waiting for a dip. MicroStrategy, however, seems to adopt a **“buy the dip”** mentality, purchasing Bitcoin whenever it aligns with their strategic vision, regardless of short-term price movements. The company’s decision to purchase even at higher prices may be a reflection of its confidence that Bitcoin is still undervalued in the grand scheme of things.

#### 3. **Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Global Economic Uncertainty**

In an era of **global economic instability**, characterized by inflationary pressures, rising debt, and geopolitical tensions, many investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. **Bitcoin’s decentralized nature** and its **limited supply** make it resistant to **inflation** and **currency devaluation**, which have become key concerns for traditional investors.

MicroStrategy’s purchase of Bitcoin at over $100,000 per coin could be a move to further **hedge against economic uncertainty**. The company may view the ongoing global instability as a signal to acquire more Bitcoin, regardless of its price, as a means of protecting its **corporate treasury**. This is a key reason why companies like MicroStrategy and other institutional investors are looking to Bitcoin to safeguard their wealth over the long term.

#### 4. **Increasing Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin**

The landscape of **institutional adoption** in Bitcoin is growing rapidly. Many large institutions, including **hedge funds**, **family offices**, and **publicly traded companies**, are increasingly looking to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets as part of a diversified portfolio. This growing interest from institutions has created **upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price**.

As the largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, MicroStrategy may be taking a strategic position to **accumulate more Bitcoin** before other large institutions make their moves. The company could be preparing to **solidify its position as a leader** in Bitcoin adoption within the corporate space, ensuring that it is well-positioned to benefit from the **institutionalization of Bitcoin** over the coming years.

#### 5. **Furthering the Case for Bitcoin as a Corporate Treasury Asset**

One of the key arguments behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases is the idea of **Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset**. Saylor has made the case that Bitcoin is a **superior asset** for companies to hold as part of their financial strategy, compared to traditional reserves like cash or gold. By continuing to accumulate Bitcoin—even at a premium price—MicroStrategy is continuing to demonstrate that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a **legitimate store of value** for corporations.

This purchase could also serve as a signal to other companies considering Bitcoin for their own balance sheets. MicroStrategy is effectively acting as a **pioneer** for **Bitcoin adoption in the corporate world**, and its actions may encourage other companies to follow suit, regardless of the current market price.

### What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future

MicroStrategy’s decision to continue purchasing Bitcoin at over $100,000 per coin highlights an important trend: **Bitcoin’s increasing legitimacy** as an asset class. While some may view the high price as risky, others see it as a sign that **Bitcoin’s value is poised to increase** as more institutional capital flows into the market.

In the coming years, MicroStrategy’s strategy could inspire more **corporate treasuries** to look at Bitcoin as a **core asset** for preserving wealth. Additionally, as the number of Bitcoin purchases from **institutions** rises, we may see even greater **price appreciation** in the future. The more corporate adoption grows, the more Bitcoin could solidify its role as a **global store of value**.

### Conclusion: MicroStrategy's Bold Move for Bitcoin

MicroStrategy’s decision to pay over **$100,000 per Bitcoin** in its latest purchases demonstrates the company’s continued confidence in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. By sticking to its strategy of using Bitcoin as a **core asset** for its corporate treasury, MicroStrategy is leading the charge for institutional adoption and showing the world that Bitcoin is a **valuable hedge** against economic instability.

While the premium price tag may raise questions in the short term, MicroStrategy is betting that Bitcoin will continue to rise in value, and its latest purchase is a signal of **strong belief in Bitcoin’s future**. As more companies and investors follow suit, we may see Bitcoin becoming an even more integral part of the global financial landscape.
